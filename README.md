# BeyondSocialNetworks

This is a repository for the [**Beyond Social Networks: Advanced Uses of Gephi in Humanities Research**](https://www.cdcs.ed.ac.uk/events/beyond-social-networks-advanced-uses-gephi-humanities-research) course provided by [**Brian Wong**](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/tsz-ho-wong) for the CDCS. Within the repository there are files with sample datasets and a guide to building datasets. It will be updated before each section.

# IMPORTANT: Things to Do Before the First Class

Before your first session, please download [**Gephi 0.10.1**](https://gephi.org/users/download/) to your own device. You can choose to download the Windows or Mac version. **It is mandatory that you install Gephi before coming to class.** This is because it takes some time to download and, due to the tight schedule, we would not be able to wait for everyone in the class to do so.

After installing Gephi, please also install the Gephi plugins. Go to the Tools menu and install **GeoLayout** and **ExportToEarth**:

Tools > Plugins > Available Plugins > GeoLayout
Tools > Plugins > Available Plugins > ExportToEarth

If you have any problems downloading Gephi, please contact Brian at twong4@ed.ac.uk.

**Please also bring a computer mouse, as you will not be able to navigate Gephi without it.**
